# microservices-using-springboot-simple-example

Spring Boot microservices project: user-service, contact-service, eureka-server, and apigateway.

1.user-service:
•	Main Class: UserServiceApplication.java
•	Service Class: UserService.java
•	Model Classes: User.java
•	REST API Endpoints: /users/{id}, /users, etc.

2.contact-service:
•	Main Class: ContactServiceApplication.java
•	Service Class: ContactService.java
•	Model Classes: Contact.java
•	REST API Endpoints: /contacts/{id}, /contacts, etc.
  
3.eureka-server(e_server):
•	Main Class: EurekaServerApplication.java
•	Configuration: application.properties (or application.yml) for Eureka Server settings.
  
4.apigateway:
•	Main Class: ApiGatewayApplication.java
•	Configuration: application.properties (or application.yml) for API Gateway settings.
•	Routes Configuration: Define routes to direct requests to appropriate microservices.
 
5.Communication between Microservices:
•	In user-service and contact-service, use Feign or RestTemplate to communicate with other services.
•	For example, user-service may need to call contact-service to get additional contact information for a user.

6.Database Configuration:
•	Configure the database connection for user-service and contact-service.
•	Each service may have its own database, depending on the requirements.

7.Eureka Server Configuration:
•	Configure eureka-server as a service registry to register and discover microservices.
•	Make sure user-service, contact-service, and apigateway register themselves with the Eureka server.

8.API Gateway Configuration:
•	Set up apigateway as a reverse proxy to route incoming requests to appropriate microservices.
•	Implement security, request/response transformation, load balancing, etc.

9.Testing:
•	Write unit tests and integration tests for user-service, contact-service, and apigateway.

10.Build and Run:
•	Build each microservice and the Eureka server using Maven or Gradle.
•	Run the Eureka server and each microservice as separate Spring Boot applications.

11.Containerization (Optional):
•	If desired, containerize each microservice and the Eureka server using Docker.

12.Deployment:
•	Deploy the microservices and the Eureka server to a cloud platform or a server.
•	Make sure the microservices can discover each other through Eureka.

13.Monitoring and Logging (Optional):
•	Implement monitoring and logging solutions for better visibility into the services' behavior and performance.
 
Please note that this is a basic outline of the content for a simple microservices project using Spring Boot and the specified components. In real-world scenarios, you would need to consider additional factors such as security, fault tolerance, scalability, and more. Additionally, proper exception handling, API documentation, and versioning are essential in a production-grade microservices architecture.
